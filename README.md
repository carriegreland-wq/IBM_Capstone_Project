# IBM Data Analytics Capstone - Job Postings Data Collection

## Project Overview
This project is part of the IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to collect data from various sources using APIs and store that data in a structured format for future analysis.

## Objective
* Connect to a Jobs API/JSON source to fetch real-time or simulated job posting data.
* Implement Python functions to filter job data by **Technology** (e.g., Python, Java) and **Location** (e.g., Boston).
* Automate the data collection process for a list of 12 key technologies.
* Export the final results into a professional Excel spreadsheet (`job-postings-all.xlsx`) for stakeholders.

## Files in this Repository
* `Collecting_job_data_using_APIs-Lab.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python logic, API calls, and data processing.
* `job-postings-all.xlsx`: The final output file containing the count of job postings for the requested technologies.

## Technologies Used
* **Python**: Primary programming language.
* **Requests**: For API communication.
* **Pandas/Openpyxl**: For data manipulation and Excel generation.
* **JupyterLite/Skills Network Labs**: Development environment.
